# autonomous-scavenger-robot

This repository contains the complete design, code, and documentation for an **Autonomous Scavenger Robot** developed as part of a mechatronics engineering project. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate a defined area, identify and collect valuable colored objects, and return them to a base station within a 120-second operation window.
